# TRACK - Tandem Repeat Analysis and Comparison Kit

The Tandem Repeat Analysis and Comparison Kit (TRACK) is an automated workflow designed to identify and compare tandem repeats (TRs) across species, and genotype catalogs in population-wide data. The pipeline includes scripts for creating TR catalogs from reference genomes, filtering TRs, generating catalogs of putative homologous TRs, and performing population-level genotyping and basic population genetics analyses. TRACK also includes scripts for visualizing TR length comparisons between species and key population genetics statistics. 

### TRACK pipeline

TRACK also provide catalogs of TRs identified in T2T genomes of ape species with [run_trf.sh](https://github.com/caroladam/TR-evolution-analyses/blob/main/run_trf.sh) and filtered with [TR_filter.sh](https://github.com/caroladam/TR-evolution-analyses/blob/main/TR_filter.sh). Reference genomes used to create TR catalogs were obtained from the T2T Consortium [Primate Project v2.0](https://github.com/marbl/Primates?tab=readme-ov-file) and [CHM13 Project v2.0](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13).
